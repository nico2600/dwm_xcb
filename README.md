dwm_xcb
=======
----------------------------------------
Personal project only for fun and profit
The main goal is to learn XCB by hacking the source code of github.com/julian-goldsmith/dwm-xcb.
For now, I try to integrate as much patches as i can from suckless repo (from tag 5.8.2 until now)

DWM is a lightweight Window manager for Linux.
Originally, it's based on X11 library which contain many unused code (old or esoteric hard/conf supported) but is about to be deprecated (Hello Wayland!).
So, I wanted to try it with XCB :-)
XCB lib is more clear/smaller than X11 and faster because it uses more "low-level" stuff
